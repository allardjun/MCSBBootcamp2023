# Installation

### On or before the first day

* Make a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one
* Install git:
    - macOS
        - Install GitHub Desktop (easier) or
        - install git (if you install GitHub Desktop, git will automatically be installed)
        - You can also use git from the terminal but you might run into password authentication issues.
        - Installing command line tools in MacOS says it will take 5 hours but is actualy much faster.
    - Windows
        - Install GitHub Desktop (easier but less full-featured) and/or
        - Install [Windows Linux Subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), and then install [git in the WLS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git) (note unlike macOS, installing git in Windows is not the same as installing git inside the WLS.)
    - Note if you have another git client, besides GitHub Desktop, you are free to use that instead!


### On or after the first day: InstallFest!

- Install [Matlab](https://www.oit.uci.edu/help/matlab/)
- Recommended but not required:
    - Install Jupyter by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
    - Install [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
    - Install [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) (Jupyter Julia)
- Install [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
    - Bring an external mouse (we have extras if you need one)
- Install [Mathematica](https://uci.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0010917)
